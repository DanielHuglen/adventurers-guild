// Utility function to calculate experience for a guild member after completing a mission
// A single experience point is awarded for each of the following criteria:
// - Agent level is two below or lower below mission level
// - Agent level is one below or lower mission level
// - Agent level is equal to or lower than mission level
// - Mission was a mixed result or better
// - Mission was a success or better
// - Mission was a critical success
